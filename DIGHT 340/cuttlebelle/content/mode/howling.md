Inspired by the popular community game mode All Random All Mid, the Howling Abyss features two teams of five champions battling over a single lane.
The summoner platform provides no healing and shopping is strictly limited to periods after your champion has died.
This pushes the map toward aggressive, high-intensity gameplay centered on team fights.

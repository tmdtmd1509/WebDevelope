The second Field of Justice added to League of Legends, Twisted Treeline, features two lanes and teams of three champions.
Champions begin play with higher starting gold totals than Summoner's Rift, sparking fast engagements and frequent team fights. A single, centralized jungle between the lanes holds capturable altars that encourage battle over neutral objectives and frequent ganking.

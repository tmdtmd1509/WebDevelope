League of Legends' flagship Field of Justice, Summoner's Rift, remains the battleground of choice for the majority of players.
Two teams of five champions battle across three lanes and an expansive jungle that holds powerful buffs and major neutral objectives.
An extended laning phase and large-scale team fights are characteristic of this battlefield.
